# Automatic Text Summarizer for Research Articles

## Project Summary

This project is a web-based tool that accepts research documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) and generates a concise, accurate **summary** of the content. Unlike simple text summarizers, it also understands **figures**, **diagrams**, and **captions** using vision-language models. And aftre extracting the text and the images, it sends the data to an LLM through API and gets the response summary

## Goal

- Make research easier to understand by providing high-quality summaries.
- Accept multiple file types and work with both **text** and **images**.
